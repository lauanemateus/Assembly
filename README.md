# Assembly
Exercises from my Assembly classes

For each classe, I have done some exercises where I translated the .c code to a .S code. The .c file contains code in C and a .S file contains code in Assembly.

To compile the codes on terminal:
```
gcc code.S main.c -o code -no-pie
```

To run the executable file:
```
./code
```
